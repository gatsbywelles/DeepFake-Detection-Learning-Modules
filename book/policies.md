## What is Deepfake? 
The term “deepfake” merges “deep learning” and “fake,” describing the process of synthesizing, altering, and manipulating existing video and audio content using artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to simulate real events (Busacca & Monaca, 2023). Through deepfake techniques, individuals can overlay or substitute one person’s face onto another’s in visual media. These methods rely on neural networks trained on extensive datasets to replicate facial movements, vocal patterns, and speech nuances. Typically, the algorithm is fed footage of two individuals, enabling it to learn how to interchange their faces. Put simply, deepfake technology leverages deep learning and AI to analyze facial dynamics and apply image mapping to replace one face with another, resulting in a convincingly fabricated video (Chadha et al., 2021).

## Types of Deepfake

### Video-Based Deepfake
+ Face-Swapping
  + This technique involves replacing the face of an individual in a video with that of another person. It’s commonly applied in film production, such as substituting a stunt performer’s face with that of the lead actor to maintain continuity and realism (Chadha et al., 2021).

+ Face-Morphing
  + Face-morphing gradually transforms one person’s facial features into another’s in a smooth, seamless transition. This method is often used in gaming environments, allowing players to upload their own photos so that in-game characters adopt their likeness—enhancing immersion and personalization (Chadha et al., 2021).
 
## Risks of Deepfake
Misinformation
Due to the affordability and widespread availability of AI tools, deepfakes pose a significant threat in spreading false information. They can be leveraged to influence political campaigns, damage reputations, and incite public unrest—particularly in an era where political activities are heavily digitized (Chauhan, 2024).

Ethical Concerns
Key ethical issues include matters of consent, the erosion of truth, and the impact on media consumption. Deepfakes are often used to produce non‑consensual pornography or other harmful material. They can also facilitate identity theft and fraud by enabling the impersonation of individuals for financial gain or other criminal purposes (Chauhan, 2024).

Cyberbullying
Deepfake technology has the potential to transform bullying dynamics. While traditional bullying typically involves direct physical confrontation or online harassment through messages and posts, deepfakes introduce new forms of abuse (Alexander, 2025). Research indicates that global rates of cyberbullying victimization among adolescents range from 13.99% to 57.5%, with notable increases over the past decade as digital technologies have become more accessible and advanced (Zhu et al., 2021).

Financial Scams
Fraudsters can exploit deepfake audio to convincingly mimic the voices of authority figures—such as CEOs or bank officials—to deceive employees or clients into transferring money or revealing sensitive data. This type of scheme manipulates the inherent trust placed in voice communications (Hery et al., 2024).
